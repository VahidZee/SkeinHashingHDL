skein_big_core:

In this function, if the data length can fit in the buffer, it will be written there, and if not, it'll change the data given in the input.

If data length is the same as the block size(512 bits), then the data will be written in blocks of hashing.

Problem occured when data length is a "multiple" of the block size (512 bits), in this situation the final bit must be set just for the final block and not the other blocks.

This function begins with making an instance of our struct, and then this function starts to
fill our struct with data and in each 512 bits, it checks that if it's the last block(last 512 bits)
or not , and if it is the last block, the final bit will written at the end of last block.

In this function loop, if there are more data to be written, we allocate some space in memory and write the struct
there and then overwrite the struct until the last block that will be saved in memory with the final bit.
