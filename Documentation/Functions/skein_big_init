skein_big_init((sph_skein_big_context *)cc, IV512) :

General :
    This function makes an instance of the struct sph_skein_big_context and sets the value of this struct with saved data for skein hashing "IV512".


Details :

    In this function, cc->hi = IV512[i] for i from 0 to 7 and then cc->bcount = 0 and cc->ptr = 0. In this function we set the value fo cc that
    is an implementation of our struct.(we initialize cc with IV512 values)
    (IV512 is a 512-bit hexadecimal number that you can see in file skein.c line 1060 )
