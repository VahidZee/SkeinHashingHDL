skein_big_core:

In this function, if the data length can fit in the buffer, it will be written there, and if not, it'll change the data given in the input.

If data length is same as block size ( 512 bit ) then data will be written in blocks of hashing.

Problem occured when data length is a "multiple" of the block size ( 512 bit ) , in this situation final bit must set just for the final block and not the other blocks.

This function begin with make an instance of our struct then this function start to
fill our struct with data and in each 512 bit it check that if it's the last block ( last 512 bits )
or not , if it's the last block, final bit will written at the end of last block.

In this function loop, if there are more data to write we allocate some space in memory and write the struct
there and then overwrite the struct until the last block that will be saved in memory with the final bit.
